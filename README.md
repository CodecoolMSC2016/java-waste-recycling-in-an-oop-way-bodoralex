# The Story

Same in the [original], but you have to write the code in Java.

# Test yourself

Do this to compile run (and test) yourself.

```
cd <repo>
javac *.java
java -ea Test
```

* **No output** means the tests are **successful**,
* **any ouutput** means the tests **failed**, see the error and on which line it was logged.
